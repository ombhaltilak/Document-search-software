# Offline Document Finder (ODF)

**"Search Like You Think"** – A Local-First, AI-Powered Document Search Engine.

## 🚀 Problem Solved

Traditional file search is broken. It relies on **exact keyword matching**, meaning if you name a file "2023_Financial_Review.pdf" and search for "Budget Report", you'll find nothing.

ODF solves this by using **Semantic Search (AI)**. It reads your documents, understands the *concepts* inside them (not just the text), and lets you search using natural language.

* **Problem**: "I don't remember the filename, just what it's about."
* **Solution**: "Show me the project files regarding the new marketing strategy." -> *Finds 'Q3_Strategy_v2.pdf'*

## 🏗️ Architecture

ODF is built as a **Native Desktop Overlay** using a modern Python stack. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and completely offline.

### 1. The Frontend (UI Layer)

* **Framework**: `CustomTkinter` (Modernized wrapper around Tkinter).
* **Design System**: "Glassmorphism" Overlay.
  * **Transparency**: `alpha=0.97` for a native, integrated feel.
  * **Windowing**: Borderless window (`overrideredirect=True`) that floats on top (`-topmost`).
  * **Theme**: Ultra-Dark (`#0d0d0d`) with Electric Blue (`#3B8ED0`) accents.
* **Global Hotkey**: Uses `keyboard` library to listen for `Ctrl+K` at the OS level to toggle the window instantly.

### 2. The Backend (Engine Layer)

* **Orchestration**: Python `threading` ensures the UI never hangs while indexing or searching.
* **Text Extraction**:
  * `pdfminer.six` for PDFs.
  * `python-docx` for Word documents.
  * Native reading for Text files.

### 3. The "Brain" (Storage & Retrieval)

* **Vector Database**: `ChromaDB` (Persistent local storage).
  * Stores the "embeddings" (mathematical representations) of your documents.
  * No external server required; runs embedded within the app.
* **AI Model**: `sentence-transformers` (specifically `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`).
  * Converts text into 384-dimensional vectors.
  * Highly optimized for semantic similarity.

## 🧠 The "RAG" Concept (Retrieve-and-Rank)

While ODF is a search engine, it utilizes the core **Retrieval** component of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems.

### How it works:

1. **Ingestion (Indexing)**:

   * Documents are split into **Chunks** (e.g., 500 characters).
   * Each chunk is passed through the AI Model to generate an **Embedding Vector**.
   * These vectors are stored in **ChromaDB**.
2. **Retrieval (The Search)**:

   * When you type a query, it is also converted into a vector.
   * We compare the *angle* (Cosine Similarity) between your query vector and all document vectors.
   * **Result**: We find the chunks that are *conceptually* closest to your query.

### 🧪 Hybrid Search Implementation

ODF uses a **Hybrid Search** strategy to ensure robustness. Pure AI search sometimes misses exact keywords (e.g., specific ID numbers), so we combine functionality:

1. **Broad Cast**: We fetch **30 candidates** (3x the needed amount) using the AI Vector Search.
2. **Keyword Check**: We scan these candidates for **Exact Substring Matches** of your query.
3. **Boosting Logic**:
   * **Title Match**: +25% Score Bonus (If filename contains the query).
   * **Content Match**: +15% Score Bonus (If text contains the query).
4. **Re-Ranking**: The final list is sorted by this new weighted score.

**Why?** This gives you the best of both worlds:

* Searching "Invoices" (Concept) finds files named "Billing_2024".
* Searching "INV-2024-001" (Exact Key) forces that specific file to the top.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

* **Local-First**: No data is ever sent to the cloud. All embeddings are calculated on your CPU.
* **Offline**: Works entirely without an internet connection.
* **Data Control**: The database lives in `data/chroma_db` and can be deleted at any time.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Launch**: Run `python main.py`.
2. **Toggle**: Press **Ctrl+K** anywhere.
3. **Index**: Click "Index Folder" and select a directory containing your documents.
4. **Search**: Type freely!
